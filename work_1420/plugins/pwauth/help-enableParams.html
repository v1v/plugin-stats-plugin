	You can enable authentication via a GET parameter, to allow automatic scripts to access the system without needing to
	go through the standard authentication.<br />
	Available parameters of authentication currently are:
	<ul>
		<li>for username: user, username, login</li>
		<li>for password: pass, password, passwd, key</li>
	</ul>
	A request would then look like this: <code>http://hudson.server.url/jobs/MyJob/?user=MyUser&pass=MyPass</code>.<br />
	<br />
	WARNING: When using this method the password will not be encrypted and can be sniffed of the network by anyone listening in.
