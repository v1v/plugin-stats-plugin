  <p>When checked, build notifications will be posted to Campfire only if:
    <ol>
      <li>there was no previous build, or</li>
      <li>if there was a failure, or</li>
      <li>if previous build failed and the current build succeeded.</li>
    </ol>
    In other words, notifications won't be sent for successful builds unless the last build was not successful.
