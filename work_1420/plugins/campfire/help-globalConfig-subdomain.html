	<p>The subdomain for your Campfire account (strictly the leaf node of the fully qualified host name). 
	This value is used to build the URL used when interacting with the Campfire API. For example, if your 
	Campfire URL is "http://mysubdomain.campfirenow.com", the subdomain setting should be "mysubdomain".</p>
