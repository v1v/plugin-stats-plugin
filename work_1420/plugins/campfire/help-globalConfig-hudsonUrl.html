	<p>Optionally specify the URL for your Hudson installation, e.g. http://yourhost.yourdomain/hudson/. 
	This value will be used to generate links back to Hudson from Campfire and should end with a forward slash.</p>
	<p>This is necessary because Hudson cannot reliably detect such a URL from within itself.</p>
